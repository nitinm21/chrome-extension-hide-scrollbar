# chrome-extension-hide-scrollbar
This is a simple chrome extension that can hide your scrollbar. Just hit ESC and you can hide your scrollbar.

I created this extension because I didn't like seeing the scrollbar when I was reading articles. The whole charade of seeing "how much of the article" is remaining was tiring.
Hence, I wanted to hide the scrollbar by just hitting ESC on my keyboard. 

To use this extension:
- Download the repo as a ZIP file
- Extract contents of the ZIP file
- Follow steps written in this article to load an unpacked extension: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/development-basics/#load-unpacked

Contact me on nitinmurali21@gmail.com if you run into any issues.

### Read this if you're a macOS user:

Please go to System Settings -> Appearance -> Show scroll bars -> Always

The extension will work only when the above setting is configured.
